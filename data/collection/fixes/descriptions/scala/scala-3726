And in consequence, if the block ends with a constant expression the constant type propagates to the whole block, which is afterwards replaced by the constant itself.

The problem manifests itself in a case like this:

```scala
def test(f: () => Int) = {
  val x = f()
  5
}
```

where the typer replaces the complete function by simply
```scala
def test(f: () => Int) = 5
```
