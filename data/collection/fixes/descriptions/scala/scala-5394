The following tail recursive function is not optimized when using `-Yvirtpatmat`
```scala
def f[T](l: List[T]): Int = l match { case x :: xs => f(xs) case Nil => 0 }
f(List.fill(10000)(0))
```
will cause a stack overflow.

Also when using `@annotation.tailrec` the compiler will report that `f` contains a call not in tail position.
