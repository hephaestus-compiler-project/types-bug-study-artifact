This feels like a bug?

Compare:

```scala
object Bug {
  sealed case class Foo(e: Option[Int])

  def loop(t: Foo): Nothing = t match {
    case Foo(Some(_)) => ???
  }
}
/*
match may not be exhaustive.
[warn] It would fail on the following input: Foo(None)
[warn]   def loop(t: Foo): Nothing = t match {
[warn]                               ^
*/
```

to this, which is also not exhaustive but produces no warning:

```scala
object Bug {
  sealed case class Foo(e: Option[Int])

  def loop(s: Foo, t: Foo): Nothing = (s,t) match {
    case (Foo(Some(_)), _) => ???
  }
}
```

I know `Tuple2` isn't sealed, but that doesn't seem to explain it (problem occurs even using a custom sealed replacement for `Tuple2`, plus the stdlib tuples participate successfully in match exhaustivity checks in some other contexts).

Any ideas?
