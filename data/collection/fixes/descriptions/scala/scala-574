given (note that this only happens when Foo's T parameter is instantiated to Object.. extending Foo<String> does not trigger this bug)

```scala
package test;

class Foo<T> {
	public void foo(T a) { }
} 

class Bar extends Foo<Object> { // only goes wrong for Object
  // scalac now sees two methods in this class:
    // method foo in class Bar of type (Any)Unit
    // method foo in class Foo of type (java.lang.Object)Unit

  public void foo(Object a) { }
}
```

and 

```scala
package test

object Test {
  // should compile, as no overloading should occur
  // crafted to produce a more meaningful error message
  val f: Nothing => Unit = (new Bar).foo 
}
```

The compiler (2.7.0-RC2) complains as follows:

```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Any
 required: java.lang.Object
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method any2stringadd in object Predef of type (Any)scala.runtime.StringAdd
 and method any2ArrowAssoc in object Predef of type [A](A)ArrowAssoc[A]
 are possible conversion functions from Any to java.lang.Object
/Users/adriaan/src/trunk/test/pending/pos/javagenerics_overloading.scala:4: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method foo in class Bar of type (Any)Unit
and  method foo in class Foo of type (java.lang.Object)Unit
match expected type (Nothing) => Unit
  val f: Nothing => Unit = (new Bar).foo // should compile, as no overloading should occur
                                     ^
