We've had reports of:

```
We are getting this error from time to time: 
error: trait Test is abstract; cannot be instantiated 
11:09:50 [ant:scalac] @Test def testClientRequestNum = { 
11:09:50 [ant:scalac] ^ 
```

I see the error is similar to one we spotted on a build here: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2107#issuecomment-13408939

The error suggests that the annotation is binding to the wrong symbol on the classpath has the same name.

I can't reproduce it, but I think I've spotted the problem. Can you?

```scala
// need to be lazy, #1782. beforeTyper to allow inferView in annotation args, SI-5892.
AnnotationInfo lazily {
  val context1 = typer.context.make(ann)
  context1.setReportErrors()
  enteringTyper(newTyper(context1) typedAnnotation ann)
}
```
