Basically, you have an implicitNotFound on a trait with type params and a partially applied type alias. If you lookup the alias and fail, the error message doesn't take the partial application into account:

```scala
scala> @scala.annotation.implicitNotFound("Could not find implicit for ${T} or ${U}") trait X[T, U]
defined trait X

scala> type Z[U] = X[Int, U]
defined type alias Z

scala> implicitly[X[Int, String]]
<console>:9: error: Could not find implicit for Int or String
              implicitly[X[Int, String]]

scala> implicitly[Z[String]]
<console>:10: error: Could not find implicit for String or
              implicitly[Z[String]]
```

That last line ought to be "Int or String".
