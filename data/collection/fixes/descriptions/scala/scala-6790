(This should really be 2.10.0-RC5, but JIRA would not let me enter that.)

I emailed scala-internals about this issue. Basically, I have a pattern match that under RC3 and earlier did not issue any warnings but which now gives the following:

<code>
[warn] /Users/erik/w/spire/src/main/scala/test.scala:2: Cannot check match for unreachability.                                                                                         
[warn] (The analysis required more space than allowed. Please try with scalac -Dscalac.patmat.analysisBudget=512 or -Dscalac.patmat.analysisBudget=off.)                                                                        
[warn]   def qux(s: String): String = s match {                                                             
[warn]                                ^                                                                     
[warn] one warning found

The suggestion (upping the analysis budget) does work, but I wonder if maybe there is a bug, since the pattern to be checked is relatively simple (a bunch of literal strings terminated by a wildcard). I have attached the test case I used.
