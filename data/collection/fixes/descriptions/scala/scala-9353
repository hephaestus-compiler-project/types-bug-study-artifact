There seems to be a bug with named arguments and the typer. The following crashes the REPL and produces a compilation error:

```scala
object Foo {
  import synth._
  import ugen._

  SynthGraph {
    val a   = FreeVerb.ar(1, mix = 0, room = 40, damp = 0)
    val b   = a ring3 -1
    val c   = Klang.ar(specs = a, freqScale = 37, freqOffset = b)
    val d   = Constant(0).max(c)
    val e   = Ball.ar(DC.ar(0), g = 46, damp = 1, friction = 0)
    val mix = Mix(Seq(e, d))
  }
}
```

To build:

```scala
scalaVersion := "2.11.6"
libraryDependencies += "de.sciss" % "scalacollider" % "1.17.2"
```

The compiler error is as follows:
```scala
Error:(15, 9) recursive value a needs type
    val x   = Klang.ar(specs = a, freqScale = 37, freqOffset = b)
        ^
Warning:(13, 34) failed to determine if 'mix = ...' is a named argument or an assignment expression.
an explicit type is required for the definition mentioned in the error message above.
    val a   = FreeVerb.ar(1, mix = 0, room = 40, damp = 0)
                                 ^
```

The REPL crashes as attached.

If I rename `val mix =` into `val foo =`, the crash disappears. Also if the type is annotated `val mix: GE =`. The explanation being that `mix` is an argument name of the first method call `FreeVerb.ar`.
