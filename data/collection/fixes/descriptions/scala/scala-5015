Take the following example:

```scala
{
  sealed trait V
  sealed trait T

  case object VA extends T with V
  case object VB extends T with V

  case object TA extends T

  def f(t: T) = t match {
    case v : V => v
    case TA => TA
  }

}
```

Here we have a sealed trait T with three concrete subtypes (VA, VB, and TA). VA and VB are both also subtypes of V. Thus, the pattern match on an instance of T where we match V should not issue a "missing combination" warning, since V will cover the cases of VA and VB.

**Expected**:
The compiler should not issue a warning.

**Actual**:
The compiler issues the following warning:
```scala
missing combination             VA
missing combination             VB

  def f(t: T) = t match {
                ^
one warning found
```
