With 2.11.3-SNAPSHOT, compiling the following,

```scala
trait Base {                                                                                                                         
  type C
  type P
}
 
trait Layer extends Base {
  trait Unapply {
    def unapply(c: C): Option[P]
  }
}
 
object Demo {
  object Module extends Layer {
    type C = CC
    type P = (Int, String)
 
    trait Companion extends Unapply {
      // This is OK
      //def unapply(c: C): Option[(Int, String)] = Some((c.i, c.s))
 
      // This fails with,
      // too many patterns for trait Companion offering Boolean: expected 0, found 2
      //   val CC(i, s) = cc
      //       ^
      def unapply(c: C): Option[P] = Some((c.i, c.s))
    }
  }
 
  class CC(val i: Int, val s: String)
  object CC extends Module.Companion
 
  val cc = new CC(23, "foo")
  val CC(i, s) = cc // failure here
}
```
results in the error "too many patterns for trait Companion offering Boolean: expected 0, found 2" at the position indicated above. Manually expanding the type alias allow compilation as expected.

Both variants compile as expected in 2.11.2, so this is a regression.
