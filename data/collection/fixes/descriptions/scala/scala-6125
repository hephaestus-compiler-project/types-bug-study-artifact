The compiler/REPL normally give an unchecked warning with `.isInstanceOf[GenericType[SomeType]]`, which makes sense since it gets type-erased to `GenericType[Object]`.

However, `.isInstanceOf[GenericType[AnotherGenericType[...]]]` does *not* give any warning, even though it is equally affected by type erasure.

I asked about this on Stack Overflow (some more examples there): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11554323/why-does-some123-isinstanceofoptionliststring-not-give-an-unchecked

The answer http://stackoverflow.com/a/11555642/319931 shows where in the compiler code the issue is; in particular "[t]he check function returns unit without performing any test" for generic types.
