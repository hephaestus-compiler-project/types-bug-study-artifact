In Scala 2.10.1, the following pattern match produces an unreachable code warning, but prints "cancelling" as expected:

```scala
object test extends App {
  type Tagged[T] = {type Tag = T}
  type @@[T, Tag] = T with Tagged[Tag]

  trait StatusTag
  type ProductStatus = (String @@ StatusTag)

  def instance(s: String) = s.asInstanceOf[ProductStatus]

  val DRAFT = instance("draft")
  val CANCELLING = instance("cancelling")

  CANCELLING match {
    case DRAFT      => println("draft")
    case CANCELLING => println("cancelling")
    case _          => println("fallback")
  }
}
```

In Scala 2.10.2 and onwards, however, the warning is still present, but the code now has started printing "fallback".

Running "scalac -print" on the code shows that the pattern matcher in 2.10.2 and onwards does a shortcut that is wrong.
