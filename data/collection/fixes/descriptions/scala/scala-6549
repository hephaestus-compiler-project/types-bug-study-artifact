If one tries to update a value in a Map by calling its corresponding setter, the REPL throws an error:

```scala
scala> case class X(var x: Int)
defined class X

scala> val m = Map('x -> X(1))
m: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Symbol,X] = Map('x -> X(1))

scala> m('x).x = 7
<console>:10: error: ')' expected but string literal found.
 + "m(scala.Symbol("x")).x: Int = " + `$ires0` + "\n" 
                    ^
```
This error occurs both in a nightly version of 2.10 and in 2.9.2, but in the latter no error message is thrown. Using an explicitly typed setter, no error occurs:

```scala
scala> m('x).x_=(7)

scala> m
res1: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Symbol,X] = Map('x -> X(7))
```
Furthermore, this error occurs only inside of the REPL, not by compiling/interpreting of a Scala source file.
