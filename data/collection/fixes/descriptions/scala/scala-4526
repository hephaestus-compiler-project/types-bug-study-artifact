= problem =
```scala
def foo(a: Int) = a match {
  case 5  => "Five!"
  case 42 => "The answer."
}

def bar(a: (Int, Int)) = a match {
  case (5, 5)  => "Two fives!"
  case (42, 21) => "The answer and a half."
}

def baz(a: (Boolean, Boolean)) = a match {
  case (true, false)  => "tf"
  case (false, true) =>  "ft"
}

```

= analysis =
It would be nice to receive some optional warning if the checks are not exhaustive and get an example value, which would result in a match error.

Like "Note: (true, true) and (false, false) are not checked and will result in a MatchError." in the last example.

= enhancement recommendation =
Add such a check to the compiler.
