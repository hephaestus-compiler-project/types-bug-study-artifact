I've stumbled across a bafflingly specific case in which a type refined by a pattern won't be inferred as equivalent to the matched type. In the code:

```scala
object RefinementTest {
  trait A[T]
  trait B[T] extends A[T]

  def takesPartial
      (first: PartialFunction[Any, Unit])
      (second: () => Unit): Unit = ???

  def foo[T](a: A[T]) {
    a match {
      case b: B[t] =>
        takesPartial({ case _ => })(() => implicitly[t =:= T])
    }
  }
}
```

the implicit evidence is not found. All of the following factors are necessary to produce this bug. If any are removed, the problem goes away:

- The context is in the body of a lambda
- The lambda is passed as the second parameter list to a function taking two parameter lists
- The first parameter list is a partial function
