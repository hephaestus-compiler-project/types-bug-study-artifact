Putting the following snippet in scala repl or compiling it will crash the compiler with an AssertionError: assertion failed: mkAttributedQualifier

```scala
    case class Outer(i: Int) { class Inner }
    object Test {
      val o1 = Outer(5)
      o1 match {
        case o @ Outer(_) => val i = new o.Inner
      }
    }
```

Changing the pattern to any of the following will allow it to compile

```scala
    case o @ Outer(5) => val i = new o.Inner
    case o: Outer => val i = new o.Inner
```

In some cases (could not reduce to short snippet) the code will compile but give "Outer is not a legal prefix for a constructor" instead of crashing the compiler.
The full stacktrace of the exception was added as an attachment.
