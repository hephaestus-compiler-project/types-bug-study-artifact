The following code does not compile:

```scala
trait Bar
trait Foo[A] { def howMany(xs: List[A]) = xs.size }

implicit def bar2foo[A](bar: Bar) = new Foo[A] {}

val bar = new Bar {}
val stuff = List(1, 2, 3)

bar howMany stuff
//<console>:13: error: type mismatch;
// found   : List[Int]
// required: List[A]
//              bar howMany stuff
```

But adding an unrelated method with the same name allows the view to be applied correctly:

```scala
trait Bar { def howMany = throw new Exception("I don't do anything!") }
//...

bar howMany stuff
// res1: Int = 3
```

This leads to unintuitive workarounds, like [this](https://gist.github.com/4131492).
