```scala
class LambdasAndImplicits {

  class MA[M[_], A](ma: M[A]) {
    def sheep = ma + " bee"
  }

  implicit def asMA[M[_], A](ma: M[A]) = new MA[M, A](ma)

  // Fails as expected:
//  (Right(1): Either[String, Int]).sheep

  // The two types are equal
  type Maybe[A] = Either[String, A]
  type MaybeLambda[A] = ({type l[x] = Either[String, x]})#l[A]

  val a = (Right(1).asInstanceOf[Maybe[Int]]).sheep
  val b = (Right(1).asInstanceOf[MaybeLambda[Int]]).sheep
  // Fails unexpectedly
  val c = (Right(1).asInstanceOf[({type l[x] = Either[String, x]})#l[Int]]).sheep

}
```

I would expect b and c to evaluate to the same result, however there seems to be some difference in handling a type alias and a type lambda?
