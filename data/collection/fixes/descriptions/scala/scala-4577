GI intend to conquer the pattern matcher this time.  Have to do some ticketizing.

The following test case reveals multiple significant issues with equality, including calling equals when it's supposed to be using reference equality, and considering a stable identifier `foo` to be unreachable on the basis that _: foo.type had not matched.  (It can actually learn nothing, because the one should be reference equality and the other should be a call to equals.)

```scala
object Test {
  val bippy    = new Symbol("bippy")
  val imposter = new Symbol("bippy")
  val notBippy = new Symbol("not-bippy")
  val syms = List(bippy, imposter, notBippy)

  class Symbol(val name: String) {
    override def equals(other: Any) = other match {
      case x: Symbol  => name == x.name
      case _          => false
    }
    override def toString = name
  }

  def f(s: Symbol) = s match {
    case _: bippy.type  => true
    case _              => false
  }
  def g(s: Symbol) = s match {
    case _: bippy.type => 1
    case `bippy`       => 2
    case _             => 3
  }
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    // should be: true false false
    syms map f foreach println
    // should be: 1 2 3
    syms map g foreach println
  }
}
```
