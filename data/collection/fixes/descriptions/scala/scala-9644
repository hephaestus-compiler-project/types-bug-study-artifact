Scala says Java annotations extend scala.annotation.Annotation, but generates invalid bytecode trying to perform this cast:

```scala
scala> import scala.annotation.Annotation
scala> import java.lang.Deprecated
scala> val x: Deprecated = null
x: Deprecated = null
​
scala> x: Annotation
java.lang.VerifyError: Bad type on operand stack
```

This happens for all Java annotations, Deprecated isn't special.

This was mentioned in a comment of #9400, but is a separate issue. Also reported [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-language/4Cjr_n3CAr0).
