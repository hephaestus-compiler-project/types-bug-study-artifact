```scala
class X[A](a: A)
object Test {
  implicit val ImplicitBoolean: Boolean = true
  def local = {
    implicit object X extends X({ def local2 = implicitly[Boolean] ; "" })
    implicitly[X[String]] // fails in 2.11.x and in ticket/9086
  }
}
```

I discovered this bug while fixing a regression in a very similar code pattern  #9086. See the comments and pull request of that ticket for analysis of this bug.

I'm separating it to a new ticket so that we can keep the other ticket focussed on fixing the regression.
