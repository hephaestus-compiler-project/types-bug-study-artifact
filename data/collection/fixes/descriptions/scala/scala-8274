Compiling the following with Scala 2.10.1:

```scala
trait Execution
trait Batch
object M {
  def batch(executions: List[Execution]): Batch = ???
}

abstract class Bug {

  def batch(executions: List[Execution]): Batch 
  def recordBatch(batch: Batch): Batch 
  def checkBatchData(recordedBatch: Batch) 
  def foo(p: Any) 

  foo {
    val inBatch = M.batch(executions = Nil)
    val batch = recordBatch(inBatch)
    checkBatchData(batch) // <-- Compiler error: "erroneous or inaccessible type"
    val executions = batch
  }

}
```

Causes a compiler error at the indicated line, but it seems spurious.
