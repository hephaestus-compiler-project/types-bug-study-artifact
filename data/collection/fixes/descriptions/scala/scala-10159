```scala
import shapeless.record.Record
object Foo {
  type K = Record.`'a -> Int`.T
  implicit val k: List[K] = Nil
}
```

While trying to adapt `Record` to have a ``'a -> Int`` member (before `Dynamic` is used), implicit search tries to type `List[K]`, failing with a cyclic reference error since `K` in the process of being initialized already.

PR forthcoming.
