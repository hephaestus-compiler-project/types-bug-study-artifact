Please find attached a large Java Enum Bar.java, to be placed in a package "foo" and compiled. It is really an enumeration of countries with > 200 entries. If you then write the very simple scala program:
```scala
object BugTest extends App {
  import Bar._
  val bar: Bar = null
  def offset: Int = bar match {
    case BULGARIA  => 2
    case _         => 3
  }

}
```
and try and compile it, it falls over with a Stack Overflow in the pattern matcher. The workaround is to give the compiler a large stack size, for example `-Xss4m`
