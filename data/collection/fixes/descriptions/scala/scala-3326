The ++ method behaves differently on a variable types as a collection.SortedMap from an immutable.SortedMap. In the former case, the "current" ordering is ignored and the default ordering used instead.

In the code appended below, if you run it as is: you will get the following output (which I would expect):

   Map(5 -> Foo, 4 -> Bar, 2 -> Hello, 1 -> World)

If, however, you change the import line as I have indicated, the following (unexpected) output occurs (i.e. the resulting map m3 has the default ordering and not that inherited from m1).

    Map(1 -> World, 2 -> Hello, 4 -> Bar, 5 -> Foo)

This is because the immutable.SortedMap trait overrides the ++ method whereas the collection.SortedMap does not (and hence the default CanBuildFrom comes into scope which, in turn, pulls in the default Ordering[Int])

Here is the code example:

```scala
object SMtest {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    import scala.collection.immutable.SortedMap //(change to scala.collection.SortedMap)
    import scala.math.Ordering

    val order = implicitly[Ordering[Int]].reverse
    var m1: SortedMap[Int, String] = SortedMap.empty(order)
    var m2: SortedMap[Int, String] = SortedMap.empty(order)

    m1 += (1 -> "World")
    m1 += (2 -> "Hello")

    m2 += (4 -> "Bar")
    m2 += (5 -> "Foo")

    val m3: SortedMap[Int, String] = m1 ++ m2
    println(m3)

  }
}
```
