This is true of 2.10.0-RC1, which is not listed as a valid version.
```scala
scala> class Foo(val x: Int) extends AnyVal { override def hashCode = 1 }
<console>:7: error: redefinition of hashCode method. See SIP-15, criterion 4. is not allowed in value class
       class Foo(val x: Int) extends AnyVal { override def hashCode = 1 }
```

But if an override is inherited, we get two different wrong behaviors: in the case of equals, no error is issued and it is ignored.  In the case of hashCode, no error is issued and it is used.

```scala
scala> trait Foo extends Any { override def equals(x: Any) = false }
defined trait Foo

scala> class Bippy(val x: Int) extends AnyVal with Foo { }
defined class Bippy

scala> new Bippy(5) == new Bippy(5)
res0: Boolean = true

scala> trait Ding extends Any { override def hashCode = -1 }
defined trait Ding

scala> class Bip(val x: Int) extends AnyVal with Ding
defined class Bip

scala> new Bip(5) hashCode

res1: Int = -1
```
