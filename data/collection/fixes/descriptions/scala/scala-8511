Given the following sealed trait, it is possible to see that at runtime there is the possibility of a MatchError being thrown -

```scala
sealed trait Expr
final case class Foo(other: Option[String]) extends Expr
final case class Bar(someConstant: String) extends Expr
final case class Baz() extends Expr
final case class EatsExhaustiveWarning(other: Reference) extends Expr
 
sealed trait Reference {
  val value: String
}
 
object Reference {
  def unapply(reference: Reference): Option[(String)] = {
    Some(reference.value)
  }
}
 
object EntryPoint {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("Successfully ran")
  }
 
  private def logic(head: Expr): String = head match {
    case Foo(_) =>
      ???
    // Commenting this line only causes the exhaustive search warning to be emitted
    case EatsExhaustiveWarning(Reference(text)) =>
      ???
  }
}
```

From the scala docs

```
If the selector of a pattern match is an instance of a sealed class (s5.2), the compilation of pattern matching can emit warnings which diagnose that a given set of patterns is not exhaustive, i.e. that there is a possibility of a MatchError being raised at run-time.
```

It seems that when the unapply method is provided for the Reference trait, no compiler warnings are emitted.
