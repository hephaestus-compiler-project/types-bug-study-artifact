The warning in the following is unnecessary:

```java
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-20120629-080700-cd1e6f94e9
[...]

def x(in: (Int, Boolean)) = in match { case (i: Int, b: Boolean) => 3 }
<console>:7: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following inputs: (_, false), (_, true)
       def x(in: (Int, Boolean)) = in match { case (i: Int, b: Boolean) => 3 }
                                   ^
```

There is no warning if the Int is ignored or bound without an explicit type:

```java
scala> def x(in: (Int, Boolean)) = in match { case (_, b: Boolean) => 3 }
x: (in: (Int, Boolean))Int
```

Keeping the explicit type for the Int but dropping the one for Boolean presents a spurious warning again:

```java
scala> def x(in: (Int, Boolean)) = in match { case (i: Int, b) => 3 }
<console>:7: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: (_, _)
       def x(in: (Int, Boolean)) = in match { case (i: Int, b) => 3 }
                                   ^

scala> x((3,true))
res2: Int = 3
```
