Using quasiquotes it is possible to construct values of the form `Some(alias @ x)`, e.g., by trying to form a tree for a value based on a pattern.

When compiling a program which uses such a macro the compiler crashes due to an uncaught exception: `java.lang.RuntimeException: We should've never gotten inside a pattern`.

If the code snippet above is valid Scala code, this error shouldn't happen. If the code is not valid, the programmer should not be able to construct it using a quasiquote.
