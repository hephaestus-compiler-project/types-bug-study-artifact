Compiling the following three files together results in the compile error suggesting that val foo can't be found (presumably because it doesn't think its type is the same type as the type library.x.Foo it's looking for).  Defining class Foo outside of class X allows it to be found.

This worked as desired in Scala 2.9.1.

```scala
// lib.scala
package library.x
class X {
  class Foo
  implicit val foo = new Foo
}

// package.scala
package library
package object x extends X

// app.scala
package app
import library.x._
object App { implicitly[Foo] }


error: could not find implicit value for parameter e: library.x.Foo
  implicitly[Foo]
            ^
one error found
```
