```scala
    object X
    def f(e: Either[Int, X.type]) = e match {
      case Left(i) => i
      case Right(X) => 0
    }
```

gives:

```
    warning: match may not be exhaustive.
    It would fail on the following input: Right(<not X>)
```
Is this correct? Surely the match is in fact exhaustive.
