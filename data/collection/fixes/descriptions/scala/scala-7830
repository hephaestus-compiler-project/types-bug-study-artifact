Also pasted below

First, a short description.  It seems that if I put an implicit for some other type in a companion object and import that implicit into scope of the class it isn't found during implicit resolution until it is referenced explicitly once(or defined above the class).  Example below.

```scala
 object Main extends App {
     
    class A(val a: String) { override def toString = s"A: $a"}
     
    object A {
      implicit val default = new A("A") //found by default
    }
     
    object B {
      def func(fn: => Int)(implicit a: A) = println(a)
    }
     
    class Broken {
      def doSomething = {
      import Broken._ // or Broken.actual
      B.func { 123 } // Uses A.default, not Broken.actual for implicit
      }
    }
     
    object Broken {
      implicit val actual = new A("Broken")
    }
     
    class Fixed {
      def doSomething = {
        import Fixed._
        println(actual) //reference actual
        B.func { 123 } // uses Fixed.actual
      }
    }
     
    object Fixed {
      implicit val actual = new A("Fixed")
    }
     
    object WTF {
      implicit val actual = new A("WTF")
    }
     
    class WTF {
      def doSomething = {
        import WTF._
        B.func { 123 } // With object definition first this works without referencing actual
      }
    }
     
    (new Broken).doSomething
    (new Fixed).doSomething
    (new WTF).doSomething
  }
```

output:

A: A
A: Fixed
A: Fixed
A: WTF

If object A doesn't have a default implicit it does error out saying no implicits are found as in the related Jira.

The problem I have though is that it compiles and finds what is obviously NOT the expected implicit.  I understand this has been addressed in many situations of "implicit not found" but I've yet to see one addressed as "wrong implicit found" which I think is much worse and why I've opened this bug report.
