In java you can write

```scala
Circle circle = CircleBuilder.create().centerX(100).centerY(115).radius(100).build();
```

This is a builder pattern which make use of existential f-bounds
The problem is that in scala the skolems get erased after two method calls and so the next method doesn't exist.


if I javap the java code
```
const #33 = NameAndType #51:#52;//  create:()Ljavafx/scene/shape/CircleBuilder;
const #34 = NameAndType #53:#54;//  centerX:(D)Ljavafx/scene/shape/CircleBuilder
;
const #35 = NameAndType #55:#54;//  centerY:(D)Ljavafx/scene/shape/CircleBuilder
;
const #36 = NameAndType #56:#54;//  radius:(D)Ljavafx/scene/shape/CircleBuilder;

const #37 = NameAndType #57:#58;//  build:()Ljavafx/scene/shape/Circle;
```
then I can see that the names and types are stored in bytecode (so a sort of runtime type info / refied generics)


In scala:
```scala
val circle = CircleBuilder.create().centerX(100).centerY(115).radius(100).build()
```

causes
```
C:\scala-2.10.0-M6\myexamples>scalac javafxbuilder.scala
javafxbuilder.scala:19: error: value centerY is not a member of ?0
      val circle = CircleBuilder.create().centerX(100).centerY(115).radius(100).
build()
                                                       ^
one error found
```

The only way to solve it in scala is to do a downcast after two methods (.asInstanceOf[CircleBuilder[_]]) or implicit conversion or to generate reified skolems _$x beforehand.
```scala
val circlebuilder = CircleBuilder.create().asInstanceOf[CircleBuilder[_ <: CircleBuilder[_ <: CircleBuilder[_ <: CircleBuilder[_]]]]]
```
which generates $_1, $_2 and $_3 for calling 6 methods (2 per skolem)

This looks a bit hackish to me and very unscala.
