I was porting some custom type mappers from ScalaQuery on 2.9.2 to Slick on 2.10 and was getting an unexpected error finding an implicit value. I was able to boil it down to the following test which runs on 2.9.2 as expected, but fails to find a value in 2.10.0-RC5. 

```scala
sealed trait V { def id: Int }
val X = new V { val id = 1 }

object ValueProviders {
  trait ValueProvider[T]
  implicit object ValueProvider extends ValueProvider[V]
}

import ValueProviders._

def foo[T: ValueProvider](value: T) = null

foo(X) // No implicit found here in 2.10
```

error: could not find implicit value for evidence parameter of type ValueProviders.ValueProvider[V{val id: Int}]

If you drop the id property or make X an instance of a non-anonymous class, everything seems to work out. In my case, this would mean losing pattern matching safety or a bunch of boiler plate.
