This is on Beta1. The trick is to have the Foo object have a method "+", which fails to type check with a String. Here, it should then unroll that implicit and call Predef.anyToStringAdd on A, but it's keeping the Foo conversion around incorrectly.

```scala
scala> case class A(x: Int);
defined class A

scala> A(3) + "H"
res0: java.lang.String = A(3)H

scala> class Foo(a: A) { println("Foo created!"); def +(x: Int) = new A(this.a.x + x); }
defined class Foo

scala> implicit def aToFoo(x: A) = new Foo(x);
aToFoo: (x: A)Foo

// This is wrong:
scala> A(3) + "H"
Foo created!
res1: java.lang.String = Foo@1c7ab89dH
```
