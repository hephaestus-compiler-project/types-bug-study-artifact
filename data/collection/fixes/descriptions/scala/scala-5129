The following code works when first compiled and then run:

```scala
object Test extends App {
  val c = ((_:Int) => new { val x = 1 }): scala.reflect.Code[_]
  println(c)
}
```

[edit: replaced repl failure with new code which fails under scalac.] When something fails in a script, it'll usually still crash in scalac given the same code layout - in this case, as follows.

```scala
object Main {
  def main(argv: Array[String]): Unit = {
    class Bippy { val c: scala.reflect.Code[_] = () => new { val x = 1 } }
    new Bippy
  }
}
```
