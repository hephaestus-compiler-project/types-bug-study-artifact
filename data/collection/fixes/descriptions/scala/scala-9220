The following,

```scala
trait Command
object Command {
  sealed trait Execution extends Command
}

case class Buzz() extends Command.Execution
case class Door() extends Command.Execution

def foo(cmd: Command.Execution) = cmd match {
  case x @ (_: Buzz) => ???
  case x @ (_: Door) => ???
}
```

results in the following spurious unreachable code warning,

```scala
[error]  bug.scala:11: unreachable code
[error]       case x @ (_: Door) => ???
[error]                             ^
```

Unnesting the `Execution` trait from the `Command` companion object results in compilation without the complaint.
