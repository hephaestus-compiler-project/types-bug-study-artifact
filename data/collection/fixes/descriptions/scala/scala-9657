Given:

```scala
scala> sealed trait PowerSource 
defined trait PowerSource

scala> case object Petrol extends PowerSource
defined object Petrol

scala> case object Pedal extends PowerSource
defined object Pedal

scala> sealed abstract class Vehicle {
     |   type A <: PowerSource
     | }
defined class Vehicle

scala> case object Bicycle extends Vehicle {
     |   type A = Pedal.type
     | }

scala> case class Bus(fuel: Int) extends Vehicle {
     |   type A = Petrol.type
     | }
defined class Bus

scala> case class Car(fuel: Int) extends Vehicle {
     |   type A = Petrol.type
     | }
```

And now the `refuel` function. Observe that there's an `unreachable` code warning that's not true.

```scala
scala> def refuel[P <: Petrol.type](vehicle: Vehicle {type A = P} ): Vehicle = vehicle match {
     |   case Car(_) => Car(100)
     |   case Bus(_) => Bus(100)
     | }
<console>:20: warning: unreachable code
         case Bus(_) => Bus(100)
                           ^
refuel: [P <: Petrol.type](vehicle: Vehicle{type A = P})Vehicle

scala> refuel(Car(100))
res6: Vehicle = Car(100)

scala> refuel(Bus(5))
res7: Vehicle = Bus(100)
```
