Consider this snippet:

```scala
trait Foo[A] {
  type Repr
  def f(a: A): Repr
}
 
object Foo {
  type Aux[A, B] = Foo[A] { type Repr = B }
}
 
object Main extends App {
  def mapWithFoo[A, B](as: List[A])(implicit foo: Foo.Aux[A, B]) =
    as map foo.f
}
```

scalac complains about that it can't convert the method to a function value, because it deems it to have a dependent type. At first glance, that seems correct. However, the following works:

```scala
  def mapWithFoo[A, B](as: List[A])(implicit foo: Foo.Aux[A, B]) =
    as map (a => foo.f(a))
```

As you can see, the "dependent" return type `Repr` is actually bound to `B`, so eta-expansion could be done.

Use case: shapeless 2.0.0-M1. Previously, the `FooAux` types were proper traits, so no dependent types involved. Now, they are type aliases in the style of `Foo.Aux`.
