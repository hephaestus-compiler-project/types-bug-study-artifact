Copying from the discussion here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-internals/QBjjb5gTQKI

A repl session in 2.11 (works the same way in 2.10):


```scala
scala> def noisyIdentity(x: AnyRef): x.type = {
     | println("got " + x)
     | x
     | }
noisyIdentity: (x: AnyRef)x.type

scala> noisyIdentity("test")
res0: String = test

// Even more weird:
scala> noisyIdentity(new java.lang.String("test"))
got test
res1: String = test
```


As you see, println did not get executed: the body of the method got replaced by the inhabitant of the ConstantType.
