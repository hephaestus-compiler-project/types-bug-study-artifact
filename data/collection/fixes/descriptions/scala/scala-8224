The following did compile with 2.10 but now "type mismatch" is reported:

```scala
import language.higherKinds

trait EL[+N] extends Equals with Serializable
type  ELI[N] = EL[N]

trait P  [N, +E[X<:N] <: EL[X]]
trait PIn[N, +E[X<:N] <: EL[X]] extends P[N,E]

trait EI [N, +E[X<:N] <: EL[X]] extends PIn[N,E]
case class NI[N](value: N) extends PIn[N, Nothing]

def seqToP[N, E[X <: N] <: ELI[X]](s: Seq[N]): Seq[PIn[N, E]] = s map {
  _ match {
    case e: EL[N] with EI[N,E] => e
    case n => NI(n)
  }
}
```

For me it would suffice to adequately alter the method definition without any change in signatures.
