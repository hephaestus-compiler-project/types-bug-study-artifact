With trunk as of 2.10.0.r26093-b20111130020250 compiling the following,

```scala
class A[T]
class B {
  def m(a: A[this.type] = new A[this.type]) { }
}

object DefaultArgBogusTypeMismatch {
  def newB = new B

  newB.m()

  // this compiles
  // val stableB = new B
  // stableB.m()
}
```

Results in the error report below,

```scala
t5259.scala:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : A[_2.type] where val _2: B
 required: A[_1.type] where val _1: B
  newB.m()
       ^
```

Adriaan's comment is that it shouldn't be necessary to existentially abstract over the "this" reference, which is what's causing the problem here.
