Scala version used: 10.4.2

I have encountered what I am fairly sure is broken behavior in case classes when members are declared using backquotes.

I have the following minimized test case:
```scala
object HelloScalaBug {

  case class wrong(`a b`: Int, a: Int)
  case class right(a: Int, `a b`: Int)

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val w = wrong(1, 2) // Should produce a 'wrong' with `a b`=1 and a=2.  Actually produces a 'wrong' w/ `a b`=1 and a=1
    val r = right(2, 1) // Produces a 'right' with `a b`=1 and a=2


    // You would think the above would produce objects whose respective fields were equal ...

    if (r.a == w.a) {
      println ("Test passes")
    } else {
      println ("Test fails")
    }
  }
}
```
