```scala
trait DeconstructorCommon[T >: Null <: Tree] {
    var field: T = null
    def get: this.type = this
    def isEmpty: Boolean = field eq null
    def unapply(s: T): this.type ={
      field = s
      this
    }
  }
trait BlockDeconstructor extends DeconstructorCommon[Block]{
    def _1: List[Tree] = field.stats
    def _2: Tree = field.expr
  }
val Block = new BlockDeconstructor{}
```

now if used in example
```scala
def foo(tree: Tree) =  tree match {
 case Block(e, e1) =>
    foo(tree)
    e1
 case _ => tree 
}
```
All references to e1 in this block will get rewritten to {code}Block._1{code}. But what happens if one calls foo on Block(Block(A, B), C). The value returned would be B instead of A.

The problem manifests itself only in run-time and does it silently. So marking this critical.
