Using scala 2.11.8 and guava 20.0 the following snippet causes the compile to crash:


```java
import com.google.common.hash.BloomFilter
object Test {
  def test() {
    BloomFilter.create(null, 1, 1)
  }
}
```


with the error:

Error in Scala compiler: trying to do lub/glb of typevar ?T
SBT builder crashed while compiling. The error message is 'trying to do lub/glb of typevar ?T' Unknown Scala Problem

In order to produce this error, I just downloaded the guava-20.0.jar
I attached an export of ScalaIDE project with the dependency
