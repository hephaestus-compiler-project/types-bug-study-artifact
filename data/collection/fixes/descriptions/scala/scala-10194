Here's a minimized reproduction based on https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/pull/23:

```scala
trait X[A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B): Unit
}

trait Y[A] extends X[A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B)(implicit ordering: Ordering[B]): Unit
}

trait Z[A] extends Y[A]

class StrawmanTest {
  (null: Y[Int]).map(x => x.toString) // compiles
  (null: Z[Int]).map(x => x.toString) // doesn't compile
}

```

This seems to hit a corner case or bug in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5307. In the second case functionProto in handleOverloaded computes a WildcardType because the abstract type A is not instantiated as expected by tp.asSeenFrom in funArgTypes. In the first case it gets instantiated as Int.
