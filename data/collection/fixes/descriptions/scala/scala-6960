I attempted to compile https://github.com/pthariensflame/scala-pipes/tree/96307c6bfb5c47661ca58b5c5cd2e589143a0f18 via sbt-extras.  The scala compiler crashed during the "typer" phase on the file `src/main/scala/org/ptflame/pipes/syntax/package.scala`, as detailed in the attached log.  https://github.com/pthariensflame/scala-pipes/commit/4571d80472f8b926530f64e9ed2f073a501fa7b8 allows it to compile.  The only difference between the two is that, in the former, the contents of the package object are declared directly within the package object, whereas in the latter, they are declared within a trait that the package object mixes in.

This behavior didn't happen at all until the former commit, and it now seems to happen no matter what I change (aside from reverting), with the single exception of the latter commit.
