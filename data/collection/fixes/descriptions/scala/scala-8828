The fix for #8324 left behind a `isEffectivelyFinal` that should have been turned into a `isEffectivelyFinalOrNotOverridden`, causing this warning to appear:

```scala
package outer

package inner {

  private[inner] class A

  // the class is final, there should be no warning
  private[outer] final class B {
    def doWork(a: A): A = a
  }
}
```
```scala
% scalac -Xlint test.scala
test.scala:10: warning: method doWork in class B references private[inner] class A.
Classes which cannot access A may be unable to override doWork.
    def doWork(a: A): A = a
        ^
```

There is no way `doWork` can be overridden, the class is final.
