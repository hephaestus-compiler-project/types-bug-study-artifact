Consider this:
{code}import scala.concurrent.duration._

trait Foo { implicit val timeout = 1 second }
trait Bar extends Foo { implicit override val timeout = 2 seconds }
```scala

In 2.10.0-RC2 and 2.10.0-RC3, the implicit conversion that gives the seconds method to Int fails:
```

<console>:11: error: value seconds is not a member of Int
       trait Bar extends Foo { implicit override val timeout = 2 seconds }
                                                                 ^
{code}

When the implicit keyword is removed from the overridden val, the implicit conversion works properly.
