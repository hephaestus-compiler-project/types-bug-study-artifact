Compile and run Maybe.scala (see the attachment).

Expected result:
some output (i.e text representation of Maybe(null) and its hashCode

Actual result:
a NullPointerException is thrown

The reason is pretty clear. Maybe(null) is wrapped to an instance of actual Maybe. According to SIP-15, the hashCode is mirrored to the field `x`. However, the field is null at the moment.

Note that the same probably applies to the equals method.

We can consider this to be either a bug or a feature.
a) Compiler should not generate a code that breaks hashCode contract. So this is a compiler bug.
b) Compiler generates a code that delegates hashCode as documented. As a result, all value classes that can wrap a null break the contract. So it is probably an undesired feature.

In both cases, the fix is probably trivial, a null check should be enough. (new Maybe(null)).hashCode can be any arbitrary value, e.g. 42.
