In the current version of Scala, pattern matching on tuples results in extra objects being created at runtime.

Consider the following MWE:
```scala
object Test {

  def slow(x: Int, y: Int): String = (x, y) match {
  	case (7, 8) => "You got it!"
  	case _ => "No such luck."
  }

  def faster(x: Int, y: Int): String = x match {
  	case 7 => 
  	  y match {
  	  	case 8 => "You got it!"
  	  	case _ => "No such luck."
  	  }
  	case _ => "No such luck."
  }

}
```
where the method `faster` in the above is some attempt to hand-optimise the implementation of the `slow` method. (I know that I will now have a duplicated case in the generated code, but you get the idea: the pair `(x,y)` has been eliminated.)

Compiling with `scalac -print` we see that the pattern matcher generates a Tuple2 when generating the bytecode for `slow`:
```
package <empty> {
  object Test extends Object {
    def slow(x: Int, y: Int): String = {
      case <synthetic> val x1: Tuple2 = new Tuple2$mcII$sp(x, y);
      case8(){
        if (x1.ne(null))
          {
            <synthetic> val p2: Int = x1._1$mcI$sp();
            <synthetic> val p3: Int = x1._2$mcI$sp();
            if (7.==(p2))
              if (8.==(p3))
                matchEnd7("You got it!")
              else
                case9()
            else
              case9()
          }
        else
          case9()
      };
      case9(){
        matchEnd7("No such luck.")
      };
      matchEnd7(x: String){
        x
      }
    };
    def faster(x: Int, y: Int): String = {
      case <synthetic> val x1: Int = x;
      (x1: Int) match {
        case 7 => {
          case <synthetic> val x1: Int = y;
          (x1: Int) match {
            case 8 => "You got it!"
            case _ => "No such luck."
          }
        }
        case _ => "No such luck."
      }
    };
    def <init>(): Test.type = {
      Test.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  }
}
```

Reading the generated code, we can see that the Tuple generation is unnecessary.

I pattern match on pairs quite often, and the extra strain of short-lived objects such that these Tuples is quite burdensome on the garbage collector, particularly in multi-threaded applications.
