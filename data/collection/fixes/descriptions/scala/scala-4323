I can't figure out for sure from code or spec what is supposed to happen here, but I feel there must be a bug when "object X" is used as the accessible fallback to "X.type".
```scala
package privates {
  object A { 
    val b = B
    val c = C
  }
  
  // givn this way it correctly fails
  // private object B
  //
  // privates.scala:4: error: private object B escapes its defining scope as part of type object privates.B
  //     val b = B
  //         ^
  // one error found
   
  // Should this type be inferred for a public val in A?
  // I would think not.  But then the fallback should be AnyRef, or ScalaObject.
  private[privates] object B
  object C
}

package other {
  object C {
    val b = privates.A.b
    val c = privates.A.c
  }
}
```
This compiles, and look at the types of b and c as inferred in other.C.
```scala
// Decides privates.B.type is off limits, so infers "object B"
scala> other.C.b _
res0: () => object privates.B = <function0>

// Doesn't mind inferring privates.C.type
scala> other.C.c _
res1: () => privates.C.type = <function0>
```
