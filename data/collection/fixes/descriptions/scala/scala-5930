-Ywarn-dead-code has an itchy trigger finger in M4. almost any pattern match sets it off:

```
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-M4

scala> 0 match { case x: Int => }
<console>:8: warning: dead code following this construct
              0 match { case x: Int => }
              ^
```

(I get dozens of these warnings when I compile my Project Euler solutions.)
