```
scala> implicit def f(s: String): PartialFunction[Throwable, Unit] = { case _ =>  }
warning: there was one feature warning; re-run with -feature for details
f: (s: String)PartialFunction[Throwable,Unit]

scala> try { ??? } catch ""

scala> try { ??? } catch "".reverse
```

The spec says:

```
The handler h is expected conform to type `scala.PartialFunction[scala.Throwable, pt]`
```

The implementation wrongly appears to assume `s/conform to/be compatible with/`.
