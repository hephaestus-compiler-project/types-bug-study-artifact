I think this deserves more than an "unchecked" warning:

```scala
scala> def f {
     | val (n, l): (String, Int) = (4, "");
     | }
warning: there were 2 unchecked warnings; re-run with -unchecked for details
f: Unit

scala> f
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String
[...]
```

This is specially surprising because this other very similar case (created from #140, which I initially thought was the same bug) works as I expected:

```scala
scala> def g {
     | val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
     | }
<console>:8: error: scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type;
 found   : String
 required: Int
       val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
               ^
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String
 required: Int
       val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
             ^
<console>:8: error: scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type;
 found   : Int
 required: String
       val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
                          ^
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: String
       val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
```
