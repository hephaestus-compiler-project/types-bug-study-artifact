The following code:

```scala
case class Foo(price: Int)
case class Bar(cost: Int)

def moo(in: AnyRef): String = in match {
	case p: {def price: Int} => "price "+p.price
	case c: {def cost: Int} => "cost "+c.cost
	case _ => "Unknown"
}

println(moo(Bar(33)))
```

results in the following compilation warnings:

```scala
pony:~/tmp dpp$$ scala -unchecked some3.scala 
(fragment of some3.scala):5: warning: refinement AnyRef{def price: Int} in type pattern is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
        case p: {def price: Int} => "price "+p.price
                 ^
(fragment of some3.scala):6: warning: refinement AnyRef{def cost: Int} in type pattern is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
        case c: {def cost: Int} => "cost "+c.cost
                 ^
two warnings found
```

However, the types can be discovered at runtime and should not be eliminated by erasure.

And yes, this could be considered an enhancement :-)
