```scala
// PrivateVal.scala
case class Foo(private val x: Int, y: Option[Int], z: Boolean)
object PrivateVal extends App {
  def foo(x: Foo) = x match {
    case Foo(x, Some(y), z) => y
    case Foo(x, y, z) => 0
  }
  val x = Foo(1, Some(2), false)
  println(foo(x))
}
```

Compiling using 2.10.0-M1 gives us:
```
PrivateVal.scala:3: error: isInstanceOf cannot test if value types are references.
  def foo(x: Foo) = x match {
                      ^
one error found
```

if we change method foo to
```scala
def foo(x: Foo) = x match {
  case Foo(x, Some(y), z) => y
  case Foo(x, None, z) => 0
}
```

the code compiles but throws CCE at runtime:
```scala
/scala PrivateVal
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Boolean cannot be cast to scala.Option
	at PrivateVal$.foo(PrivateVal.scala:4)
	at PrivateVal$delayedInit$body.apply(PrivateVal.scala:9)
```

Ouch! If you compile it with -Xprint:cleanup you'll notice:
```scala
def foo(x: Foo): Int = {
      <synthetic> val temp2: Foo = x;
      if (temp2.ne(null))
        {
          <synthetic> val temp4: Boolean = temp2.z();
          val y: Option = scala.Boolean.box(temp4).$asInstanceOf[Option]();
          if (PrivateVal.this.gd1$1(y))
...
```

Which means pattern matching is completely confused about the arity (and thus types) of our case class.

Both definitions of foo this worked in 2.9.x so it's a regression. However, the whole idea of having private vals in case classes feels weird. We declare a member to be private but then we can access it through a pattern match (in 2.9.x). I think we should simply disallow private vals in case class's primary constructor. Proposed way to move forward:
1. bring back questionable semantics of 2.9.x back to master
2. Deprecate private vals in primary constructor of a case class
3. Disallow it in the next major release of Scala

PS. `-Yvirtpatmat` fails to handle private vals properly as well.
PS2. The test-case has been extracted with blood and tears from specs2 by me and Nada Amin.
