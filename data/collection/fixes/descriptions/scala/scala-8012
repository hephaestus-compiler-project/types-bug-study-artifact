I don't really know what's going on here, but I've managed to create a consistent reproduction case on an open-source project. I've tagged a project snapshot here: https://github.com/holograph/accord/tree/compiler-hang (accessible via git at `git@github.com:holograph/accord.git`); just run `sbt compile` and you'll see it hang.

Specifically, the `com.tomergabel.accord.dsl` is a package object that extends `com.tomergabel.accord.combinators.NumericOps[_]`; I'm not even sure this is valid, but that's definitely the culprit as removing the extends clause makes the problem go away instantly and permanently.

Although I'm not familiar with the compiler internals, I ran a quick jstack (output attached) and it's very obvious this is a fault condition in the typechecker. I'd love to help further but I'm really at a loss here...
