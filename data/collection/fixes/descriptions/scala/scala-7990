With `-Xstrict-inference`, per #6680:

The inferred type of `blah` below should have something like `forSome &#123;type A >: AnyVal&#125;` at the end of it; instead, it refers to the (now free) type variable `A` from `BoxF`.

```scala
scala> sealed abstract class Box[+A]; case class BoxF[A](f: A => A) extends Box[A]
defined class Box
defined class BoxF

scala> def blah = ((BoxF((_:Int)+1):Box[AnyVal]) match {case BoxF(f) => f; case _ => ???})
blah: A => A

scala> def blah2 = (blah, blah)
blah2: (A => A, A => A)

scala> blah2 : ((A => A, A => A) forSome {type A})
res0: (A => A, A => A) forSome { type A } = (<function1>,<function1>)
```

I shouldn't be able to give the ascription that resulted in `res0`.

Notwithstanding what seems to be merely a printing issue (the two `A` s in the `blah4` definition seem to be different internally, as expected), when I throw out the free variable explicitly I get what I expect.

```scala
scala> def blah3 = blah : ((A => A) forSome {type A})
blah3: A => A forSome { type A }

scala> def blah4 = (blah3, blah3)
blah4: (A => A, A => A) forSome { type A; type A }

scala> blah4 : ((A => A, A => A) forSome {type A})
<console>:14: error: type mismatch;
