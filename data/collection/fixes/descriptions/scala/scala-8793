This is very related to #8128, but still exhibits similar behaviour in 2.11.2.

```scala
package regr 

trait F[A]

class G(val a: F[_], val b: F[_])

object G {
  def unapply(g: G) = Some((g.a, g.b))
}

object H {
  def unapply(g: G) = g match {
    case G(a, _) => Some(a)
  }
}
```

results in (from H.unapply):

```
error during expansion of this match (this is a scalac bug). 
The underlying error was: type mismatch;
  found   : regr.F[_$1(in method unapply)(in method unapply)(in method unapply)(in method unapply)] where type _$1(in method unapply)(in method unapply)(in method unapply)(in method unapply)
  required: regr.F[_$1(in method unapply)(in method unapply)(in method unapply)(in method unapply)]	Regr.scala
