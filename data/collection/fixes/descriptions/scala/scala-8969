Welcome to Scala version 2.11.1-20141007-151233-f67aa50599 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_65).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> object Test {
     |   def a[R](implicit s: List[R]):Int = 0
     |   def a_=[R](v: Int)(implicit s: List[R]) = ()
     | }
defined object Test

scala> import Test._
import Test._

scala> implicit val implicitVal:List[Int]=null
implicitVal: List[Int] = null

scala> a_=(1)

scala> a = 1
<console>:50: error: reassignment to val
       a = 1
         ^
```

So the syntactic sugar version "a = 1" is rejected while the (I presume) equivalent raw version "a_=(1)" is accepted.

This does not seem to happen when the implicit parameter is of a type that is not parameterized:

```scala
scala> object Test1 {
     |   def b(implicit s: String) = 0
     |   def b_=(v: Int)(implicit s: String) = ()
     | }
defined object Test1

scala> import Test1._
import Test1._

scala> implicit val implicitString = ""
implicitString: String = ""

scala> b_=(1)

scala> b = 1
b: Int = 0
```

Issue #4237 has a title that also covers this problem: "Syntactic sugar for calling mutator doesn't always work"; however it has already been closed.
