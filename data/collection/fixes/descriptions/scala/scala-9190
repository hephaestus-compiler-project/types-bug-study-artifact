The following snippet results in compilation error with scala 2.11.x (full stacktrace in attachment). Note that only two patterns together (with extractor first) in match clause brings error.

```
java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: (trait Two,type One)
```

```scala
trait Test {
  trait Two[A, B]
  type One[A] = Two[A, A]

  object Extract {
    def unapply(o: One[_]): Option[_] = ???
  }

  def matcher[T](o: One[T]) = o match {
    case Extract(t) => ??? // extractor alone is ok
    case _: One[_]  => ??? // other pattern in conjunction with extractor causes error
    case _          => ??? // wildcard pattern is also ok
  }
}
```

Scala version 2.10.4 compiles fine. This seems to be a regression introduced in 2.11.0 and affected subsequent versions.
