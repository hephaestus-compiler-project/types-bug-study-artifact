There seems to be an issue when using a generic extractor and which could receive a tuple type. As soon as the generic type parameter in the result type is instantiated with a tuple type, the pattern matcher interprets it as multiple parameters in a match.

```scala
object Foo {
  def unapply[S, T](scrutinee: S)(implicit witness: FooHasType[S, T]): Option[T] = scrutinee match {
    case i: Int => Some((i, i).asInstanceOf[T])
  }
}

class FooHasType[S, T]
object FooHasType {
  implicit object int extends FooHasType[Int, (Int, Int)]
}

object Test {
  val x = 8
  x match {
    case Foo(p) => p // p should be a pair of Int
  }
}
```

This should compile. However, it instead results in the following error:
```scala
<console>:21: error: wrong number of arguments for object Foo
           case Foo(p) => p // p should be a pair of Int
                   ^
<console>:21: error: not found: value p
           case Foo(p) => p // p should be a pair of Int
                          ^
```

The work-around to use the `FooHasType` implicit to force `T` to be `Any` in the case where it would otherwise be a tuple does not completely solve the issue because then the type info for the components of the tuple gets lost.

So, the bottom line: it seems this bug makes it impossible to provide a representation-independent extractor for types such as `Try`.
