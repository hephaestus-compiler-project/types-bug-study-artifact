In the following code an implicit conversion gets applied even though it is not required. The code works correctly when a full function name (including package) is used.

```scala
object Main {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    import pkg._

    val p0 = new PrivateI(new Clue)
    println("I was given a clue, and found a " + p0.found + ".")

    val p1 = new Policeman(new Clue)
    println("I was given a clue, and found a " + p1.found + ".")
  }
}

package pkg {

  class Clue
  trait Red
  trait Herring[T]
  class RedHerring extends Herring[Red]

  class PrivateI(val clue: Clue) {
    def found = find(clue)
  }

  class Policeman(val clue: Clue) {
    def found = pkg.find(clue)
  }
}

package object pkg {
  implicit def convert(s: Clue) :RedHerring = new RedHerring

  def find(clue: Clue) :String = clue.getClass.getSimpleName
  def find(fish: Herring[_]) :String = fish.getClass.getSimpleName
}
```


=== What is the expected behavior? ===
"find(Clue)" should be called both times.

=== What do you see instead? ===
An implicit conversion gets applied and "find(Herring[_])" is called instead.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.final
