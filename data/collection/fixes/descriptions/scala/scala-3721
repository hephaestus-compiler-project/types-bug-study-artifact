hi,

i am having a lot of implicit conversions for default arguments using my DSL. for instance:

```scala
object BufRd {
   def ar( numChannels: Int, bufID: GE, phase: GE = 0, loop: GE = 1, interp: GE = 2 ) : GE = ...
}
```

where integers and floats are converted to a GE using an implicit conversion in the scope. now, the result is that scaladoc generates this:

```scala
def ar(numChannels: Int, bufID: GE, phase: GE = de.sciss.synth.package.floatToGE(0), loop: GE = de.sciss.synth.package.floatToGE(1), interp: GE = de.sciss.synth.package.floatToGE(2)): GE
```

which obviously is very ugly and barely readable.

i thus propose an enhancement, for example in the form of a scaladoc switch, to not resolve implicit conversions in the doc-generation but to keep the original readable form of the signatures.
