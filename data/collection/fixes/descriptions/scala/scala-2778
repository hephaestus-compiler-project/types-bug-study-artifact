The problem did not manifest in a cut down problem. I'll keep trying to boil it down, but for now you need to use the entire scalaz project to reproduce.

Steps to reproduce:

 1. Install SBT booter version 0.6.0
 2. svn checkout -r 1202 http://scalaz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ scalaz
 3. cd scalaz
 3. sbt compile 

After successful compilation of the `core` module, the `http` module will fail with:
```scala
scalaz.this.Applicative.applicative is not a valid implicit value for scalaz.this.Applicative[scala.this.Option] because:
polymorphic expression cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : [<deferred> <param> Z[<deferred> <param> _]]scalaz.this.Applicative[Z]
 required: scalaz.this.Applicative[scala.this.Option]
[error] E:\code\scalaz\http\src\main\scala\scalaz\http\Version.scala:85: could not find implicit value for parameter a: scalaz.Applicative[Option]
[error]       List(major, minor) ? ((c: Char) => isDigit(c).option(c.toLong - 48L)) map { case List(maj, min) => version(maj, min) }   
```

Joint compilation using IntelliJ works fine.

Note that uncommenting http/src/main/scala/scalaz/Version.scala:90 works around the problem, although compilation will fail during icode with an unrelated bug that seems to be triggered by -Ylog-implicits -Ydebug.
