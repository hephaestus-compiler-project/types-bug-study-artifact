I got a new exhaustivity warning when switching to 2.10.0-M7 and it *seems* spurious to me, but it involves existentials so I'm not sure.

To reproduce this warning, we first need to define a sealed abstract class or sealed trait:

```scala
scala> sealed abstract class FoundNode[T]
defined class FoundNode
```
and then tuple it with another parameterized *case class*, like `Some` (a fresh case class would also be fine, but `Option` wouldn't).

```scala
scala> object Foo {
     | val v: (Some[_], FoundNode[_]) = (???, ???)
     |   v match {
     |     case (x: Some[t], _) =>
     |   }
     | }
<console>:10: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: (_, _)
         v match {
         ^
defined module Foo
```

The warning is triggered by matching the first component, of type `Some[_]`, against `x: Some[t]` (or `x: Some[_]`). Removing that match removes the warning, as do a lot of other changes. Since the first component has type `Some[_]`, I believe it will *always* match against `Some[_]`, even if I think of existentials the correct way, so I think the warning is spurious.

Necessary conditions to reproduce this warning seem to be that the scrutinee:

- must be a tuple;
- must have a sealed component (above, `FoundNode`);
- must have a parametererized case class component (above, `Some`);
- finally, the matching must include a typed pattern match on the parameterized case class component (above, `: Some[_]`).

I tried to alter the above example to violate any of those conditions, but that suppresses the warning; I made my experiments available here:
