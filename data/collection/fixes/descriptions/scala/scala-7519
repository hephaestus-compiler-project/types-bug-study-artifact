```scala
class C /*#1*/{
  implicit def conversion(m: Int)(implicit nada: Nothing): String = ???

  class C /*#2*/ { // rename class to get correct error.
    locally(0 : String) // "value conversion is not a member of C.this.C"
  }
}
```

The offending code:

```scala
// Typer#adapt
case _ =>
  debuglog("fallback on implicits: " + tree + "/" + resetAllAttrs(original))
  val tree1 = typed(resetAllAttrs(original), mode, WildcardType)
  // Q: `typed` already calls `pluginsTyped` and `adapt`. the only difference here is that
  // we pass `EmptyTree` as the `original`. intended? added in 2009 (53d98e7d42) by martin.
  tree1.tpe = pluginsTyped(tree1.tpe, this, tree1, mode, pt)
  if (tree1.isEmpty) tree1 else adapt(tree1, mode, pt, EmptyTree)
```

The winning implicit conversion is inferred as a symful `Select(This(C#1), "conversion")`. The `resetAllAttrs` brutalizes this tree, and upon retypechecking we end up with `This(C#2)`.

`resetLocalAttrs` seems like a better option here.

The same problem arises with the two classes share the name "$anon".

```scala
trait T; trait U
new T {
  implicit def conversion(m: Int)(implicit nada: Nothing): String = ???

  new U { // rename class to get correct error.
    locally(0 : String) // "value conversion is not a member of U"
  }
}
```
