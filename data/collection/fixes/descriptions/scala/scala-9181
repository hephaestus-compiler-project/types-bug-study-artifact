Exhaustivity checking becomes a significant proportion of compilation time when the number of case clauses exceeds about 100. Given this source (for 400 case clauses),

the compilation time appears to scale worse than linearly if and only if the trait is marked `sealed`, as shown on the attached graph.

@paulp reports that this is a regression from 2.11.4.
