To reproduce, create two source files:

```scala
// Foo.java
public enum Foo {
    A,
    B
}
```

```scala
// Bar.scala
object Bar {
    def baz(foo: Foo) = foo match {
        case Foo.A => 1
    }
}
```

and then try compiling `Bar.scala` while passing `Foo.java` to `scalac` (without compiling it first). No warning will be printed, even though the pattern match isn't exhaustive.
```
$ scalac Foo.java Bar.scala
```
If, however, the enum is compiled first and then excluded from scalac run, the warning is printed as expected:

```
$ javac Foo.java 
$ scalac Bar.scala 
Bar.scala:2: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: B
    def baz(foo: Foo) = foo match {
                        ^
one warning found
```
