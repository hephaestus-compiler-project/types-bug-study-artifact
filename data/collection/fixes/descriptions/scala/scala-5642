This bug report focuses (mostly) on different problems with simplification of intersection types. I wanted to report one bug, but I just got too many errors by fiddling with the same code; my apologies. I still believe this bug report to be useful.

I see an error message (about an actual error) mentioning `Coll with Traversable[T] with Traversable[T]` instead of `Coll with Traversable[T]`. Additionally, given that `Coll` is bound in a constraint `Coll <: Traversable[T]`, this should simplify further to `Coll`, even though this type appears in an invariant context. If this were the case, the problems below would not show up.

The following is supposed to give an idea of what's happening, but it is not (yet) fully reduced.
```scala
trait Exp[+T] //Expression type, somewhat à la Lightweight Modular Staging but simpler.
sealed trait Forceable[T, Coll] {...} //type-class

def benchQuery[T, Coll <: Traversable[T]](msg: String,
                                            v: Exp[Coll],
                                            expectedResult: Traversable[T],
                                            extraOptims: Seq[(String, Exp[Nothing] => Exp[Nothing])], timeScala: Double)(implicit f: Forceable[T, Coll]): Traversable[T]

class UnconvertedExp[+T](val v: T)
  //Removing the constraints causes type inference problems:
  implicit def toQuery[T, Repr <: Traversable[T]](t: Exp[Repr with Traversable[T]]): UnconvertedExp[Exp[Repr with Traversable[T]]] = new UnconvertedExp(t)

  //Ensure that the parameter was not implicitly converted to Exp.
def Query[T, Repr <: Traversable[T]](t: UnconvertedExp[Exp[Repr with Traversable[T]]]): Exp[Repr with Traversable[T]] = t.v

//Code triggering the error:
def benchQueryComplete[T, Coll <: Traversable[T]](msg: String)
                                                   (expected: => Traversable[T])
                                                   (query: => Exp[Coll],
                                                    extraOptims: Seq[(String, Exp[Nothing] => Exp[Nothing])] = Seq.empty) {

val builtQuery = Query(query)
benchQuery("", builtQuery, expectedRes, extraOptims, timeScala) //error line
```
Error:
```scala
could not find implicit value for parameter f: ivm.expressiontree.Lifting.Forceable[T,Coll with Traversable[T] with Traversable[T]]
```

Not having time to fully reduce this code, I tried annotating `builtQuery` to show the result of type inference, producing this code:

```scala
val builtQuery: Exp[Traversable[T]] = Query[T, Coll](query)
benchQuery("%s Los" format msg, builtQuery, expectedRes, extraOptims, timeScala)
```
But then I got an even worse error:
```scala
type mismatch;
[error]  found   : ivm.expressiontree.Exp[Coll]
[error]  required: ivm.expressiontree.Lifting.UnconvertedExp[ivm.expressiontree.Exp[Coll with Traversable[T]]]
[error]     val builtQuery: Exp[Traversable[T]] = Query[T, Coll](query)
[error]                                                          ^
ivm.expressiontree.Exp[Coll] <: ivm.expressiontree.Lifting.UnconvertedExp[ivm.expressiontree.Exp[Coll with Traversable[T]]]?
  <notype> <: ivm.expressiontree.Lifting.UnconvertedExp[ivm.expressiontree.Exp[Coll with Traversable[T]]]?
  false
false
[error] one error found
```

That's worse because it can be fixed by inserting an implicit conversion:

```scala
    val builtQuery: Exp[Traversable[T]] = Query[T, Coll](toQuery[T, Coll](query))
    benchQuery("%s Los" format msg, builtQuery, expectedRes, extraOptims, timeScala)
```
However, I do need that type annotation on the implicit conversion. Otherwise, using just `toQuery(query)`, I get:
```scala
type mismatch;
[error]  found   : ivm.expressiontree.Exp[Coll]
[error]  required: ivm.expressiontree.Exp[Nothing with Traversable[?]]
[error]     val builtQuery: Exp[Traversable[T]] = Query[T, Coll](toQuery(query))
[error]                                                                  ^
[error]                                                                  ^
ivm.expressiontree.Exp[Coll] <: ivm.expressiontree.Exp[Nothing with Traversable[?]]?
  Coll <: Nothing with Traversable[?]?
    Coll <: Nothing?
      <notype> <: Nothing?
      false
[...]
```
Here the compiler is deducing apparently `Repr = Nothing` in the call to `toQuery`, which is completely unexpected since `toQuery`'s declaration uses the somewhat-well-known workaround to SI-5298. The only difference I see and that should matter (if bugs make some sense) is that `query` is a call-by-name parameter: `query: => Exp[Coll]`.
