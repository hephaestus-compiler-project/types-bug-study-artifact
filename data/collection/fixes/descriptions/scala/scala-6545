After upgrading to Java 7, I was curious to see if it would have any performance impact on the places where I use structural dispatch in my project.  I guess `ClassNotFoundException` pops up pretty quickly, but it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for.... :-)

It seems that the `-Ystruct-dispatch:invoke-dynamic` option is still based on an early version of the JSR, when the code still lived in `java.dyn`.  It has since been refactored a bit and transitioned into `java.lang.invoke`.

Easily worked around by going back to cached dispatch.
