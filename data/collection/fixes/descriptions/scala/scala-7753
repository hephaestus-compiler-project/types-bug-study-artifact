In the following example (I'm afraid I haven't been able to significantly reduce it further), the equivalence of `si.Out` and `si.instance.Out` has been lost at the call sites of `direct` and `indirect`.

Notice that in `direct` the type `si.Out` is known in the second parameter block at the call site, and so the expression typechecks. However in `indirect` the type `si.instance.Out` is unknown or, at least, is sufficiently opaque to prevent the second expression from typechecking. 

`si.Out` is defined in terms of the implicitly summoned `i`, so if `si.Out =:= i.Out` is available at the call sites of `direct` and `indirect` then intuitively it seems that `si.instance.Out =:= i.Out` (where `si.instance: i.type`) should be available too.

```scala
package si

import scala.language.{ higherKinds, implicitConversions }

trait Foo[T] { type Out }

object Foo {
  implicit def mkFoo1: Foo[Boolean] { type Out = Int } =
    new Foo[Boolean] { type Out = Int }
}

trait SI[TC[_]] {
  type T
  val instance: TC[T]
  type Out
}

object SI {
  implicit def conv[TC[_] <: { type Out }, T0](t: T0)
    (implicit i: TC[T0]): SI[TC] { type T = T0 ; type Out = i.Out } =
      new SI[TC] {
        type T = T0
        val instance: i.type = i
        type Out = i.Out
      }
}

object Test {
  def direct(si: SI[Foo])(v: si.Out) = v

  val v1: Int = direct(true)(23)    // OK

  def indirect(si: SI[Foo])(v: si.instance.Out) = v

  val v2: Int = indirect(true)(23)  // Fails
  // test.scala:35: error: type mismatch;
  //  found   : Int(23)
  //  required: si.instance.Out
  //   val i: Int = indirect(true)(23)
  //                               ^
}
