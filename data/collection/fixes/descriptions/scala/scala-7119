The following:

```
package filter

import akka.actor.Actor

trait FilteringActor extends Actor {
  
  type Message
  
  def output: Message => Unit
  
  /** Default is to just forward everything. */
  override def receive = {
    case m: (Message @unchecked) => output(m)
  }

}
```

when compiled with -unchecked, produces:

```
type FilteringActor.this.Message @unchecked in type pattern FilteringActor.this.Message @unchecked is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
[warn]     case m: (Message @unchecked) => output(m)
[warn]                       ^
[warn] one warning found
```

I tried adding the parentheses around (Message @unchecked), but it makes no difference whether they are there or not.
